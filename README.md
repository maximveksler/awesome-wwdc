# Conference
‚ùïNo selfie sticks   
‚ùïLectures this year strech all the way to friday

[MacRumors WWDC Roundup](http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/) - Updated with the latest info

### Tips
 - **Carry a business card**.   
Apple employees wont give you their, but will accept yours
 - **Labs are for rockstars, come early to register your slot**.
 - **Speed up your check-in**.   
Apple emailed you a personal Passbook for faster check-in at Moscone West. You can check in starting Sunday, June 7 at 9:00 a.m. 
 - **Download the WWDC app**.   
[Get the app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwdc/id640199958?mt=8) to mark your favorite special events, lunchtime speakers, and Get Togethers. After the keynote you‚Äôll be able to view the full schedule and get access to news updates, session videos, and more throughout the week.
 - **Bring all your gear**.   
Make sure to pack your Mac with the latest developer tools installed, iOS devices for testing, and essential peripherals like power and Ethernet adapters.
 - **Sandwiches are delivered during launch time**.
   - They are usually meh at best. Lactose-intolerant sandwiches taste better.

### Keynote

Keynote is the opening highlight of the conference. Usually a line begins to form starting at 6am to get good seats. If you prefer the chillback apporach, arrive at 8:30, to amend the popularity there is a second stadium with live video. AltConf has a [standstanding-room](http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2015/03/30/release-notes-joins-forces-with-altconf/) live stream as well.

 - Come early if you want to get good seats close to the stage.
   - Bring a chair with you to sit through the line. Make it foldble for extra "the guards won't throw it away" points.
   - Waiting the line is an adventure and you should treat it as such, you will meet amazing people and optionally form life lasting friendships.
   - Come in a group. Makes taking coffee trips much easier.
 - Wi-Fi usually dies during the keynote due to high demand, no work arounds. Be prepared.
   - Do not use [MiFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znxQOPFg2mo)
